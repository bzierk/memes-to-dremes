Our submission to Oregon State University's Spring 2021 "BeaverHacks" hackathon. The theme of the hackathon was "Fintech" and given the current viral status of all things crypto, we decided to build out a program to take advantage of that culture.

# memes-to-dremes
Desktop app which allows the user to select twitter users to monitor for tweets related to the cryptocurrency of their choice. Our desktop app will use sentiment analysis to give an immediate buy/sell notification when one of the selected influencers sends a tweet about the chosen cryptocurrency. In addition to notifications, users can open the desktop app to scroll through a history of previous crypto-related tweets.
